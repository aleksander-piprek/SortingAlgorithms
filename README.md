# SortingAlgorithms
Repository is dedicated to create a simple framework to test sorting algorithms

* Creating *Unsorted* objects creates a vector specified in range given in the constructor parameter
* New algorithms will be tested such as bubble sort, merge sort,
* Time and memory complexity and usage will be implemented in the framework
* GUI to present visually sorting in real time (QT);
