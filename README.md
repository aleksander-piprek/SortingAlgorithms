# SortingAlgorithms
Repository is dedicated to create a simple framework to test sorting algorithms. To use the early version of the framework:

1. Create *Unsorted* object with range passed as a parameter to create a random vector of integers in the specified range
2. Create an algorithm object from any of the implemented sorting algorithms
3. Pass the created vector in Step 1. as a parameter of given sorting algorithm to test it

## TODO:
* New algorithms,
* Time and memory complexity and usage,
* GUI to present visually sorting in real time (QT);

## Average times for unsorted vector of size 10,000:
- std::sort() ~ 3 ms
- bubble_sort ~ 2.6 s
